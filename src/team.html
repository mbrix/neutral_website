                      David Li is a professor at Shanghai Advanced Institute of 
                      Finance (SAIF), affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

                      The Financial Times has called him "the world’s most influential 
                      actuary." His paper "On Default Correlation: A Copula Function 
                      Approach" was the first appearance of the Gaussian copula 
                      applied to CDOs published in 2000, which quickly became a 
                      tool for financial institutions to correlate associations 
                      between multiple financial securities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Most recently, he was the head of modeling for AIG Investments. 
                      He was previously with China International Capital Corporation 
                      (CICC) Limited, Barclays Capital, and Citigroup. As one of the 
                      early pioneers in credit derivatives, he has established a 
                      valuation methodology which has been become the market standard: 
                      the Gaussian copula model or Li model. His work has been featured 
                      on the front page of The Wall Street Journal. He initiated 
                      and built the first commercial CDO software, CDO Manager, 
                      at the RiskMetrics Group (RMG).
